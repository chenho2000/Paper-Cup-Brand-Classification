## Overview
A computer vision system for detecting Tim Hortons cups (Timmies) and generic paper cups in images using YOLOv11. The project covers the full ML lifecycle from data collection to deployment.

## Features
- High Accuracy: 99.3% mAP50 on validation set
- Real-time Inference: ~5ms per image on T4 GPU
- Comprehensive Monitoring: Grafana dashboards for metrics tracking
- CI/CD Ready: Dockerized API with health checks

## Model Performance

| Metric     | YOLOv11m | YOLOv11l |
|------------|----------|----------|
| mAP50      | 0.993    | 0.992    |
| Recall     | 0.981    | 0.981    |
| Precision  | 0.989    | 0.985    |

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker 20+
- NVIDIA GPU (recommended)
